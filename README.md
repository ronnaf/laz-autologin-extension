# Laz Auto-login Extension
Chrome Extension to automatically log in on Lazada. For Ronna's use only :)

### Why?
Lazada does not persist log in credentials which sucks for lazy people like me.

If you want to use it yourself:
- This extension is basically just an auto-clicker
- This extension only logs in with Facebook
- This extension is untested
- The logo is pretty cool though
