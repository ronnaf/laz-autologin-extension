# Laz Auto-login Extension

Chrome Extension to automatically log in on Lazada. For Ronna's use only :)

![preview 2 1 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32459751/157216050-56592652-2372-4e96-870a-769357a2d8b3.png)

### Why?

Lazada does not persist log in credentials which sucks for lazy people like me.

If you want to use it yourself:

- This extension is basically just an auto-clicker
- This extension only logs in with Facebook and Google
- You have to manually slide the verification slider if it appears
- This extension is untested
- The logo is pretty cool though
